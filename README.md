Hey! üçª

My name's Adrian, but everyone calls me Sinclair. I'm a self-taught fullstack developer and have been tinkering since 2016. I'm a high-functioning autistic who struggles to maintain focus on a single project at a time, so try not to look at the repositories panel. 

My biggest project is called Noderalis. It's currently in private development but is a website builder gone native like the old days of Dreamweaver but with modern tooling and frameworks such as Next.js with future support for creating applications through Tauri.

## Other experience

I'm always learning and trying to build new things, but my main goal is to develop tools to help developers work faster. Eliminating anything that isn't DRY out of common routines, or even bringing tools that don't exist natively on another system. I used to have a tool called xTouch which brought `touch` on Linux to Windows before WSL was a thing and you could just spin up Ubuntu commands on a windows filesystem.
